Upon evaluating all 3 models, it can be concluded-

Accuracy: As far as the accuracy of the model is concerned, Logistic Regression performs better than SVM, which in turn performs better than Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

F1-score: The F1 Scores for class 0 and class 1 are :
- For class 0: Bernoulli Naive Bayes(accuracy = 0.90) < SVM (accuracy =0.91) < Logistic Regression (accuracy = 0.92)
- For class 1: Bernoulli Naive Bayes (accuracy = 0.66) < SVM (accuracy = 0.68) < Logistic Regression (accuracy = 0.69)

AUC Score: All three models have the same ROC-AUC score.

We, therefore, conclude that the LOGISTIC REGRESSION is the best model for the above-given dataset.
